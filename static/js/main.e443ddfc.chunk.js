Royal Foods is a distribution center that services grocery stores mostly within the tristate area but also to other areas through cross-dock. I am the person who made sure the distribution center had what the store needed. In order to do that, I placed orders to many different manufacturers daily. We had all different sorts of products with different shelf lives. Fresh, Frozen, and Shelf Stable. Each category with a wide range of shelf lives for each product. Every single Manufacturer was its own vast array of data to analyze. I had to look at all the things mentioned above as well as knowing which grocery stores are having sales on what products when and what kind of increase in sales that means to determine what quantity to buy for every item. On top of that, I negotiated promo windows with our manufacturers and made pricing models that would determine our selling price out to grocery stores. The 4 years that I spent at Royal Foods has given me a great ability to analyze and see trends in all sorts of data. I gained a well-rounded knowledge of the business as a whole and I continue to bring that knowledge to the table every day at Target."}),Object(c.jsxs)("p",{children:["I came to Target through the Item COE on the MIT Team where I worked for 3 years analyzing data of all formats, growing an extensive knowledge of excel and automating processes with VBA.
